# Description
The project took me a couple of months, but it really helped me to realise how important the MVVM pattern and enterprise patterns in general are, because at first I studied only WPF and I was not good enough to build the whole application, but after learning MVVM I could make any interface. In general, the tree structure is implemented here, the entities of which are stored in the database.

## Task
```
Create a WPF (WinForms) application for working with data from task 6 (and extend it for a new entity - Teacher)
1. On the default page - show a list of courses. When the course is selected - show a list of groups for the selected course. When the group is selected - show a list of students for the selected group. (You can replace course and group lists with a treeview)
2. A separate page for create/delete groups and edit group (change group name, select/update teacher of group).
1. It's also necessary to add functionality (buttons) for export/import a list of students of a group to a csv file (separator is ","). Before importing students into a group, you have to clear the group where you are uploading new students.
A group can not be deleted if there is at least one student in this group.
2. There should be an ability to create a docx/pdf file with a list of the group, with the following
content:
The document title:
- the course name
- the group name
The document itself:
- a numbered list of students (full name)
3. A separate page for editing students (add, update and delete), Change student data (name, surname)
4. Add a new entity Teacher (name, surname). Add the page for editing (add, update and delete).
```
